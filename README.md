# My Marvelous Memoir

An online personal diary app that allows you to create daily posts which you can edit and delete at anytime.

## Purpose

It has proven over and over again that keeping a journal/private dairy has been effective in helping with anxiety. As someone who suffers from anxiety myself, I wanted to create an app to help people suffering from stress/anxiety that they could use from anywhere.

## Recommended Usage

For testing purposes, I recommend you test our web app with the following login credentials -

- Username: Demouser
